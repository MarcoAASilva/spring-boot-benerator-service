# Spring-Boot Command Line Demo

A template for (CLI)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface] applications using Spring Boot

# Goal

Provide a working template for building command line tools that leverage the features of Spring-Boot

# Motivation

CLI tools are very flexible, generally good for prototyping and exploration.

Most CLI tools start out as simple main() functions.  But any useful tool will eventually require ever more complex features and configurations.

(Spring Boot)[https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/] makes it easiear to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications  

In general, [learning resources for Spring](https://spring.io/guides) are not too bad.

This demo goes a few steps beyond [spring-boot-sample-simple](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-simple)
